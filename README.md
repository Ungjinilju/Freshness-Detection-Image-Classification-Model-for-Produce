# **Freshness Detection: Image Classification Model for Produce**

This repository contains an image classification model designed to assess the freshness of produce. The project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify produce as either **fresh** or **rotten**, providing a valuable tool for quality control in agricultural and retail industries.

---

## üöÄ **Features**
- Classifies produce into **fresh** or **rotten** categories.
- Pre-trained models (e.g., **InceptionV3**, **Xception**) for enhanced accuracy.
- Supports custom datasets with automatic data preprocessing.
- Includes Grad-CAM visualization for interpreting model predictions.
- Modular structure for easy experimentation and model updates.
- Incorporates the [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) object detection model to identify produce.

## üìä **Results**
- **Model Accuracy:** 93% on the validation dataset
- **Grad-CAM Insights:** Highlights the regions of the image that influenced predictions the most.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - **Precision:** 93%
  - **Loss:** 0.2360

## üìù **Steps Overview**

### Step 1: Freshness Classification (2 Classes)
- Classifies apples into fresh and rotten categories.
- Uses a binary classification model trained on apple images.
### Step 2: Multi-class Classification
- **Step 2-1**: Classifies 6 types of produce (e.g., apples, oranges, bananas, etc.) as either fresh or rotten (2 classes per produce type).
- **Step 2-2**: Classifies 9 types of produce (e.g., apples, oranges, bananas, etc.) into 18 classes (fresh or rotten for each type of produce).
### Step 3: YOLO-based Rotten Area Detection
- Uses YOLOv5 for detecting and calculating the rotten area on an apple.
- Calculates the percentage of the rotten area compared to the total apple area.
- Divides this percentage into 10 classes to assess the degree of rottenness.
